    3. Write a JavaScript program that accepts five numbers in five prompts and
    displays the larger one in the console.
    <script>
        let firstNumber = +prompt("Enter the first number:");
        let secondNumber = +prompt("Enter the second number:");
        let thirdNumber = +prompt("Enter the third number:");
        let fourthNumber = +prompt("Enter the fourth number:");
        let fifthNumber = +prompt("Enter the fifth number:");

        let largestNumber = firstNumber;
        // i am not using if-else ladder due to cause it stops in first condition which gets true and i am done with it
        if (secondNumber > largestNumber) {
            largestNumber = secondNumber;
        }
        if (thirdNumber > largestNumber) {
            largestNumber = thirdNumber;
        }
        if (fourthNumber > largestNumber) {
            largestNumber = fourthNumber;
        }

        if (fifthNumber > largestNumber) {
            largestNumber = fifthNumber;
        }

        console.log("The largest number is: " + largestNumber);
